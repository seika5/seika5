### Hello! I'm Ryan Mar
## :sparkles: About Me
I'm studying Computer Science @ University of Southern California. <br/> <br/>
My coding journey began at 10 years old with Minecraft command blocks, developing minigames to play with my friends. Now, I enjoy building end-to-end system architecture, working with machine learning, and solving real-world problems.
